Seting Up:

2)	Open Microsoft Qbasic and open "main.bas" and press "F5"
3)	Enjoy!

Objective:
1)	Get Nabman from the grey square in the top left corner of the screen
	to the bottom right corner and press "SPACE BAR".
2)	Get Nabman back up to the first grey patch again and press space.

N.B.	You start with 10 lives.  When you get to the second corner you will
